## After Removing Backgrounds

### Step 1: Replace Image Files
Copy the new background-free images to:
```
c:\Users\arvii\Desktop\OSIP\images\
```

### Step 2: Test Locally
Open your website with Python server:
```powershell
cd c:\Users\arvii\Desktop\OSIP
python -m http.server 8000
```

Go to: http://localhost:8000/product.html

### Step 3: Push to GitHub
```powershell
git add images/
git commit -m "Update product images with transparent backgrounds"
git push origin main
```

---

## Expected Result

**Before:** Product images with backgrounds (yellow circles, tables, etc.)
**After:** Only the product visible with transparent background (PNG transparency)

The CSS is already configured to display these perfectly:
- âœ… Transparent background support
- âœ… Drop shadow for depth
- âœ… Proper sizing and centering
- âœ… Hover effects

---

## Tips for Best Results

1. **Use PNG format** - Supports transparency (not JPG)
2. **High resolution** - Start with good quality images
3. **Clean edges** - Remove.bg works best with clear product edges
4. **Consistent lighting** - Products photographed on white/solid backgrounds work best

## Alternative: CSS Workaround (Temporary)

If you can't remove backgrounds right now, I can add CSS to blend white backgrounds better, but true transparency looks much more professional.

Let me know if you need the CSS workaround!
